      			<p>If you or your child is following a low-phenylalanine diet, you'll need to keep records of the food eaten every day to be sure you're sticking to the specific, individualized dietary guidelines recommended by your dietitian.</p>

<p>To be as accurate as possible, measure the portions of your food using standard measuring cups and spoons and a kitchen scale that reads in grams. The food amounts are compared to a food list or are used to calculate the amount of phenylalanine eaten every day. Each meal and snack includes the appropriately divided portion of your daily PKU formula.</p>

<p>Food diaries or computer programs are available that list the amount of phenylalanine in baby foods, solid foods, PKU formulas, and common baking and cooking ingredients.</p>

      			<p>Because the amount of phenylalanine that a person with PKU can safely eat is so low, it's crucial to avoid all high-protein foods, such as milk, eggs, cheese, nuts, soybeans, beans, chicken, beef, pork, fish. Potatoes, grains and other vegetables that have protein will likely be limited.</p>

<p>Children and adults also need to avoid certain other foods and beverages, including many diet sodas and other drinks that contain aspartame. Aspartame, found in many artificial sweeteners, releases phenylalanine when digested.</p>

<p>Some medications may contain aspartame and some vitamins or other supplements may contain amino acids or skim milk powder. Check with your pharmacist about the contents of over-the-counter or prescription medications. Talk with your doctor or dietitian to learn more about your specific dietary needs.</p>

      			<p>Because of the restricted diet, someone with PKU needs to get essential nutrition through a formula that's a special nutritional supplement for people with PKU. The phenylalanine-free formula provides protein and other essential nutrients in a form that's safe for people with PKU. </p>

<p>Formula for older children and adults. Older children and adults continue to drink or eat a protein substitute formula daily, as directed by a doctor or dietitian. Your daily dose of formula is divided between your meals and snacks, instead of consumed all at once. The formula for older children and adults is not the same as the one used for infants, but it works on the same principle. It acts as an essential nutritional substitute and is continued for life.</p>

<p>The need for a nutritional supplement, especially if your child doesn't find it palatable, and the limited food choices can make the PKU diet challenging. But families need to commit to this lifestyle change wholeheartedly because it's the only way to prevent the serious health problems that people with PKU can develop.</p>
